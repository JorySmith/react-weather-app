# React Weather App

A weather web application built with React

I apologize but this project will not support HTTPS GET requests because the weather API wants users to pay $10/month for HTTPS GET request access.

The way to view this project is to pull it and run a local server to display the weather app.

I will create another weather app in React that doesn't require paying an API a monthly fee in the near future.
